# Introductory Findings in FAO
A simple but intermediate view on the Food and Agriculture statistics on a few specific datasets.

The findings were tailored with the idea of identifying the specific crops that could impact the fast food industry. Forms of impact include advising fast food companies 
to invest in certain farms in specific countries for production of specific crops which may prove to be advantageous for the growth of targeted crops, hence allowing the 
min-max of cost of production of targeted crops to sales margins in terms of sales of food. With that in mind, we chose the following datasets that were most involved
with said industry, which are:
1. Cabbages and other brassicas
2. Lettuce and Chicory
3. Sugar cane
4. Tomatoes
5. Wheat
6. Potato

Thank you to my fellow friends on helping out with this little repo as well, without you pointing out my mistakes, this would have been impossible:
